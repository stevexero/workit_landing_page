## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I learned about the importance of a proper css reset as opposed to using the universal selector. In this project I used Eric Meyer's CSS Reset (see below).

### Continued development

### Useful resources

- [Eric Meyers CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/) - Eric Meyer's CSS reset eliminates cross-browser inconsistencies and streamlines the styling process, providing a uniform base across all browsers. This approach improves code maintainability and layout predictability.
